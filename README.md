# AtlasRecon: Subdomain Enumeration and Active Recon using SSL Scanning

**AtlasRecon**  is a powerful  **subdomain enumeration**  framework designed to perform  **active recon**  by scanning the IP ranges of major internet service providers. It analyzes SSL certificates found on port 443 and helps uncover  **subdomains**  through  **active recon**  techniques. This repository collects and shares the results of these  **active reconnaissance**  activities, focusing on  **SSL certificate analysis**  and  **subdomain discovery**.

This repository contains data for  subdomain enumeration  on the following  **cloud service providers**:
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**
- **Akamai**
- **Cloudflare**
- **Fastly**
- **GCP (Google Cloud Platform)**
- **Oracle**

The data shared includes only the results of  **SSL certificate analysis**  and the  **subdomains**  discovered through  **active SSL scanning**.


## Data Structure
In this repository, the data is provided in  **JSON format**. Each file represents a collection of  **SSL certificate data**  and  **subdomain enumeration results**  obtained from a specific provider and date.

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "host": "3.5.140.169",
      "ip": "3.5.140.169",
      "port": 443,
      "tlsVersion": "TLSv1.2",
      "subjectCN": "*.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com",
      "subjectAltName": "DNS:*.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com, DNS:s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com"
    },
    {
